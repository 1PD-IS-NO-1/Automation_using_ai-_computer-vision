2. # **AI AGENT (LangChain & LangGraph)**
**User can upload any Csv data file and machine learning model name and agent will train the model and print the accuracy of trained ML algorithm model.**
**the aim of this code is to just drop your csv data , tell me the ml algo name which you want to trained on dataset with target varibale.After of that it will give the accuracy of trained model.**


**I am going to make An agent project by which user can get trained ML model on any dataset.**

**I am going to use Langchain & Langgraph due to it's complexity and  functionality.**


 **1. Data cleaner agent**

**2. Feature engineer agent**

**3. Model Trainer agent**

**4. Data science specialist node - it will work only on if any error will come in training.**


# **Project workflow edges Logic**
**Data Cleaner → ✅ Success → Feature Engineer**

**Data Cleaner → ❌ Error → Specialist**

**Feature Engineer → ✅ Success → Model Trainer**

**Feature Engineer → ❌ Error → Specialist**

**Model Trainer → ✅ Success → END**

**Model Trainer → ❌ Error → Specialist**

**Specialist → ✅ Fixed → Go back to failed step**

**Specialist → ❌ Not Fixed → END**


# **Agent Graph using langgraph (node & edges direction)**
